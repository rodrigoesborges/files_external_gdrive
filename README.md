# Files External Google Drive (Nextcloud app)
  Google Drive external storage support for Nextcloud (still in Beta)


# Installation

First of all, you need to enable the `files_external` app.

# Usage
## Google configuration

In order to use the app, you need to create an OAuth2 client via: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/

Complete all needed information, as:
